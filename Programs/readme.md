# Directory of reusable Programs

* Programs.ev3s: Container of all EV3 Programs
* _Name_.ev3s: Individual Program used for development and testing where _Program_ is the **Name** of the Program.  e.g. `Menu.ev3s` 
is the file that is used to develop the **Menu** Program

Developers should NOT modify the **Program.ev3s** container file.
To modify an individual program, create a new branch named **dev-_program_** e.g. **dev-menu** to develop the **menu** program** and 
request a Pull to **master** branch when you are ready to submit your changes.  Make sure there are no other branches open for 
that block before you do this.  Contact Legoliers CM if you are unsure of how to do this.
