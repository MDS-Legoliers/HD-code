# Directory of reusable MyBlocks

* MyBlocks.ev3s: Container of all MyBlocks
* _Name_ Block.ev3s: Individual MyBlock used for development and testing where _Name_ is the **Name** of the MyBlock.  e.g. `Move Inches Block.ev3s` is the file that is used to develop the **Move Inches** MyBlock

Developers should NOT modify the **MyBlocks.ev3s** container file.
To modify an individual block, create a new branch named _dev-blockname_ e.g. **dev-move-inches** and request a Pull to **master** branch when you are ready to submit your changes.  Make sure there are no other branches open for that block before you do this.  Contact Legoliers CM (Configuration Manager) if you are unsure of how to do this.
